## Pull Request Process

1. Make sure you have created tests for your new feature (if possible). Also run 
 all existing tests to prevent breaking changes.
2. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the 
 layer when doing a build.
3. Update the current documentation and [README.md](README.md) with details of 
 changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, useful file 
 locations and container parameters. Also update the requirements.txt if necessary.
4. There is an attempt to aim for the [SemVer](http://semver.org/) version system.
 Additionally, you can find a list of plans for the future of `GraphDonkey` in the
 [README.md](README.md). Figure out which version your PR can be a part of and
 change the corresponding values (mainly `main.extra.Constants.APP_VERSION`). PRs
 that do not take the future features into account **will not** be merged.
5. Only PRs with [valid file formatting](wiki/Formatting.md) will be accepted.
