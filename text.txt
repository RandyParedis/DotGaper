TODO FUTURE [0.1.3]
    - Opening from as many file types as possible
    - Smart File Encoding detection
            ==> Document-specific properties
    - For DEBUG only: Open parse tree of dotfile as dotfile
    - Force autocompleter to suggest context-specific items
    - Automatic bracket insert
    - Scope closing/collapsing
            ==> i.e. a plus and minus sign next to the line numbers will allow a user to collapse whole sections
    - Opening and closing seems to take a while (splash)
            - Loading screen / window (with progress bar?)
            - Closing screen / window (with progress bar?)
            ==> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12682888/qt-c-aligning-qprogressbar-inside-a-qsplashscreen/12686191
