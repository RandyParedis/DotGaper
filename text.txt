TODO (see also README.md)
        - If the parse tree is re-ran, it must be done so from the first block
            ==> Now, if there is a bug on line 1 and you fix it on line 4, line 1 remains highlighted in red
            ==> Maybe via ExtraSelections? (see Bracket Matching)
        - Efficient Selection lines algorithm vs current one
        - Add parser warnings
        - Snippets
            - Insert from snippets into code
            - Tree view? ==> Store snippets as json and insert at cursor on drag & drop
            - Add/Edit/Remove snippets
        - Custom RMB menu in Editor
            ==> In Qt, this is called a ContextMenu

TODO FUTURE [0.1.3]
    - Additional configuration possibilities for graphviz
    - Smart File Encoding detection
    - Shortcut for find next occurrence of selection (JetBrains ALT+J)
        ==> Multiple cursors?
    - Remember last cursor position on startup
    - Allow opening from multiple files
        ==> Turn Dockwidget into tabbed pane
    - Opening from as many file types as possible
    - Scope closing/collapsing
            ==> i.e. a plus and minus sign next to the line numbers will allow a user to collapse whole sections
    - Automatic bracket insert
    - Display whitespaces option
        ==> https://www.qtcentre.org/threads/27245-Printing-white-spaces-in-QPlainTextEdit-the-QtCreator-way
    - Force autocompleter to suggest context-specific items
    - For DEBUG only: Open parse tree of dotfile as dotfile
    - Fix all TODOs
