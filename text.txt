TODO: - Save File => Save as text (gv, canvas, dot...)
                     Allow saving file with errors/comments
      - Add Export Function  (actually strips comments and crashes on errors)
      - Remove Auto-Updater (for now)
      - Bugfix: Copy not working iff file was closed
                i.e.: Closing a file seems to clear the clipboard
      - Syntax Highlighting does not work 100% as intended

TODO| FUTURE (see also README.md)
        - Autocomplete [live-searching for possibilities depending on AST]
        - Add parser warnings
        - Duplicate line/selection
        - Find + Replace window
        - Snippets
        - Custom RMB menu in Editor
            ==> In Qt, this is called a ContextMenu
