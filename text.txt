    pyrcc5 -o tango.py -compress 9 tango.qrc

TODO LIST
    - Smart File Encoding detection
            ==> Document-specific properties?
    - Force autocompleter to suggest context-specific items
    - Other file types
        - dot/graphviz itself
            - attribute checking?
        - flowchart
            - function calls
        - PlantUML?
        - Mermaid?
        - plain/plain-ext
        - pic
        - lark
        - xdot?
        - Convertion function
            - Open new file with filetype gv, transformed from the file ext
        - Plugin System
            - Additional settings/preferences
                ==> Creates new tab in preferences menu
            - Custom about window
            - Highlighter & Parser
                ==> Custom Syntax to Graphviz function
            - Conversion function
                - To Graphviz
                - To Binary data (image)
            - Possible with executable?
                ==> All plugins are a (json, exe)-pair
                    ==> Allows mapping of 'semantic check function' to command
                    ==> Allows mapping of 'DSL to Graphviz/Image' to command
                    + see above
            - If conversion to image is defined: always use this mapping
                - If svg: render as svg
                - Else: render as pixmap
            - If conversion to graphviz is defined: convert to graphviz and render as such (current)
            - If both defined: depend on option in preferences ("prefer graphviz rendering", default TRUE)
            - FUTURE: Conversion to custom syntax can be defined: map to custom syntax and use OGDF algos for layout
                ==> If defined, use this ("prefer rendering as <graphviz|OGDF|image|none>")
                    - For "none": disable view area
    - Update all highlighting on typing!
    - Syntax highlighting order of rules!
    - CodeEditor must be language-specific!
    - Fix in-code TODOs
