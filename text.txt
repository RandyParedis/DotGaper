TODO FUTURE [0.1.3]
    - Remove a shortcut (RMB/ContextMenu?)
    - Additional configuration possibilities for graphviz
    - Opening from as many file types as possible
    - Layers?
            ==> https://graphviz.gitlab.io/faq/#FaqOverlays
    - Smart File Encoding detection
            ==> Document-specific properties
    - For DEBUG only: Open parse tree of dotfile as dotfile
    - Force autocompleter to suggest context-specific items
    - Automatic bracket insert
    - Scope closing/collapsing
            ==> i.e. a plus and minus sign next to the line numbers will allow a user to collapse whole sections
    - Opening and closing seems to take a while
            - Loading screen / window (with progress bar?)
            - Closing screen / window (with progress bar?)
    - Fix most TODOs

Version 1.0.0 name ideas:

    - Wannabe Unicorn
