TODO FUTURE [0.1.3]
    - Additional configuration possibilities for graphviz
    - Smart File Encoding detection
            ==> Document-specific properties
    - Opening from as many file types as possible
    - Scope closing/collapsing
            ==> i.e. a plus and minus sign next to the line numbers will allow a user to collapse whole sections
    - Automatic bracket insert
    - Force autocompleter to suggest context-specific items
    - For DEBUG only: Open parse tree of dotfile as dotfile
    - Fix most TODOs
    - Layers?
