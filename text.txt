TODO FUTURE [0.1.3]
    - Additional configuration possibilities for graphviz
    - Smart File Encoding detection
    - Remember last cursor position on startup
    - Fully decouple CodeEditor, making it a standalone source that also works in any project/situation.
    - Allow opening from multiple files
        ==> Turn Dockwidget into tabbed pane
    - Opening from as many file types as possible
    - Scope closing/collapsing
            ==> i.e. a plus and minus sign next to the line numbers will allow a user to collapse whole sections
    - Automatic bracket insert
    - Display whitespaces option
        ==> https://www.qtcentre.org/threads/27245-Printing-white-spaces-in-QPlainTextEdit-the-QtCreator-way
    - Force autocompleter to suggest context-specific items
    - For DEBUG only: Open parse tree of dotfile as dotfile
    - Fix most TODOs
